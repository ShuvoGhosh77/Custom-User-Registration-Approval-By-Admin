# Custom User Registration & Admin Approval

**Custom User Registration & Admin Approval** is a WordPress  that allows administrators to manually approve new user registrations before they can log in. When a user registers, they remain in a pending state until an admin approves them from the WordPress dashboard.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Custom user registration form
- ✅ Admin approval system before login
- ✅ "Approve" button in the WordPress Users dashboard
- ✅ Restricted login for unapproved users
- ✅ Works seamlessly with WordPress user management

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. A user registers through the custom registration form.
2. The user is added to the database with a "pending" status.
3. In the WordPress **Users** section, an admin sees the new user with an "Approve" button.
4. Once the admin clicks **Approve**, the user can log in.
